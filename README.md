# Personal Website

I just put random shit on here, dont mind me please. This was based of my sites.google.com/view/gaphoto website since i want to learn more HTML and CSS.
I'm gonna learn in the future to make a bar at the top of the screen like my google sites website, mostly for navagation purposes.

Made this with Visual Studio Code and the Live Preview extension, most of the programming done on a Macbook and Windows PC.

I used a lot of CSS Cheat Sheets and button references to create the custom CSS you see on this website.
